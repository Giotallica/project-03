<center><h2><p1>

	In the Kingdom of Talidad, there was a King who was a weak minded buffoon. He searched for riches and vanity. He was a man of god Adeo, the lord of lords, the kings of kings. The king was corrupt and only gave to the rich and ignore  the poor. He twisted things that the scriptures say and would go against what the priest and prophets say. King Ingarsis went with his idea and wanted to rule longer than his life span. His eldest son, Guevarous was about to reign over his father as what the prophecy writes. Adeo spoke to him about this plan. “Guevarous, you will overcome this Kingdom of Talidad and and overthrow your foolish father for he has been corrupt and drained with the riches of Earth and not from the spirit and the kingdom of Zanidus. You must become the new king, report to elder prophet Wielle so he can promote you.” Young Guevarous saw Adeo as a man with gold hair, white robe and fire as his eyes. He spoke to him and then vanished into the air. Guevarous was astonished and the next morning, with clouds in the sky and the sun flowing down its light, Guevarous reached elder prophet Wielle and spoke about what Adeo commanded. Prophet said this is to happen, he anointed him and pour the water of purity on him. A glow of gold flow through Guevarous. He became the new king of Talidad. Guevarous was to now talk to the King, his father. His father held a strange feeling captive inside his body temple and was realizing his eldest son was old enough to take over. 
King Ingarsis met his son at the outside of the palace. “My son you, you seem different.” said the king. “My father, if you may, I must become the king.” replied Guevarous. “Guevarous my son, why so soon, you're far too young and know not of a rulership as I” “Father, I must, it's my destiny”  “ Father, I must, or we’ll all die.” the king then said “My son, you are not my son for your foolish, you are corrupt and want to steal my throne, I won’t allow it.” King Ingarsis walked to his palace, left Guevarous where he was. Ingarsis spoke to Wielle and asked if this prophecy was true, He replied that it is to be. Ingarsis planned to kill his son. He gathered his army and asked who ever kills him, is rewarded with his wife. Lustfull the soldiers charge out. Adeo woke up Guevarous and told him to march away from the kingdom, it is corrupt and his own father plans to end his life. Guevarous ran away from his homeland. He did what he told him and was stranded in the plains. 
He waited by rocks and hid in caves by the mountainside. King Ingarsis, furious, waited no longer and rushed his army to search and destroy, they set signs up all over the kingdom. Guevarous then saw Adeo through a rock, he sees a ghastly form of a body in a robe. The eyes glowing green and the whisp flowing through as it guides him. He spoke with a loud low key voice and said “ Remain here my son, your brother, I will call for, he will gather the holy of the kingdom and will meet you here. You my son, will be the king of this tribe, The Guevarians, you’ll rule by my guide and will find the promise land. Years of years you’ll search with Guevarians, once you’ll found it. Establish it and claim it under my name, until then you’ll be a prosperous king and will join many others up in the kingdom of Zanidus with me.” Adeo then turned into a fire and the fire was set on top of the rock. Lunas, Guevarous’s brother was told by Adeo and he gathered his family, his friends and the ones who are pure under Adeo such as believers, poor men, priest and prophets. The Guevarians marched under the starlight that guided them. They finally met at the rock of fire. They were scared but Guevarous said “Don’t worry, this isn’t sorcery, its Adeo, he sent a fire to this rock where he once stood, he made a signal for you to find where I am at. And I see you’ve found it.” They then gathered all around. The first night, the slept on the hard flow, they brought covers and clothing for the slumber. They slept and the next morning, Guevarous gathered the men and women to have their occupation. Men gather meat and foods and resources. Women gather fruits and farm the land. Children play and obeyed their parents. Prophets and priest set up a temple that is supported by wood, and rich cloth such as silk and, they also carried jewelry with them. Adeo told the priest and prophets on how to structure the temple, they placed an altar in the middle of it with diamonds, sapphires and emeralds emulating all over the altar. They surround the area with sticks to support the roof, which is made out of silk. Walls are silk that is purple and the entranced is a curtain. Once they finished, they assemble everyone to worship Adeo inside it. Guevarous spotted a trouting army. Guevarous then told the Guevarians to pack up the things and to move onward, for the army of Talidad is coming to slaughter everyone. Panic and screaming, the tribe does instead, Guevarous yelled, and said to not panic, for that is a key for failure. They then did what he said and marched onward. Out of reach of the Talidad army, they stopped at another spot. Only one tree in the oasis area. They settled and began to break down their things. Guevarous gathered strong men to become their army. He demanded men to gather resources to craft weapons. Some of which they brought with them. After 11 hours, the next day they gathered all in a line. Guevarous chose his leader for the army. They set out to find a peaceful civilization to trade with their jewels and get armor and more weapons. The Guevarians returned with their armor, it was sufficient for every soldier. Guevarous then positioned himself as the main leader of this army. They planted crops and had a surplus of bread. Guevarous then gathered his army and told them to rush to the horses and to  break them. They hid behind tall grass. They then charged to the horses and did their best to tame them. After 40 minutes. They got their horses. Guevarous was a black stallion, he named him after himself. They trotted back to their spot. The other men build a fort where the soldiers remained. The men pitch up tents where the women and children stayed. The leader reported a charging army to Guevarous. It was a large army of the Galverians. They came in a herd and was ready to battle. Guevarous went with his army to fight. It was an army with 100 men against one with 500. They battled day and night and with the power of Adeo on their side, they managed to seek their victory and hold it. More than half of Guevarous army lost but he still won. The Galverians lost their soldiers and returned back to where they came from. The army returned back to their terrain. Guevarous told the story of the battle as they gathered around the feast of victory. 
The next morning, a famine struck the land and then the  Guevarians had to leave the area. It took 30 years to find a perfect spot. During the years, they found spots, but would immediately leave every 1 of a day, they hardly stayed in an area for a day, Guevarous would sacrifice his sleep to lead, men and women slept on horses, while soldiers slowly walked the horses so they won’t fall. Wars, battles, natural disasters, such as earthquakes, hot days setting fires, famine, causes doubt to the tribe and they finally decided to praise something. They found a large stone and carved a god out of it. It was a head of an eagle, remembering freedom and a body of a soldier, resembling strength, they praised it, Guevarous, the prophets and the priest disliked this betrayal to them and to Adeo. Guevarous prayed to Adeo so that he can show them a Miracle so they can believe in him again and to never doubt. His prayer was answered and Adeo opened the night skies and stars were falling, once it hit the ground, it formed to grain and bread. They ate it and Guevarous said, “This is a gift from our god, Adeo, he forgave you for sinning and worshipping this idol. For now on you must pray to Adeo and your prayers will be granted.” The tribe members took his word and did what he said. Then suddenly, lighting struck by the mountain side. “Brother, it is the law of Adeo, we must go find it.” said Lunas. Guevarous then traveled with his men to the mountainside and was told by a loud voice, it was Adeo, “Guevarous, you in honor, will lead these people with my laws, here I will place the word into these stone tablets, all must obey!” The lighting struck on two rocks on the mountain and they turned into stone tablets, the hold the law. Guevarous hold the laws up to the sky and a roar of thunder was heard throughout the land. Painters and scriptures recorded this event and became a legendary scene. Guevarous held the stones with responsibility and told the priest to write them into scrolls, so incase the stones break, they’ll have copies. The next day, the traveled over the mountain and met a civilization. They encountered their land and had a conflict, the civilization was not friendly and threaten them with violence. The war began, soldiers attacked the enemies team and killed a 3rd of their army. Guevarous held a knife and stabbed one of the soldiers in the throat, He wrote his experience of all the battles in a diary scroll he had and learned to write from his father. 
The war lasted for 40 years, finally the day of the war was over. Guevarous, injured, and his army 80% taken out. His men went to the cities land and took out the leader and his ministries. They took the slaves but 2 soldiers and a government found Guevarous, took him as hostage. Lunas, in a vision was told to lead the army and leave the land. They left as soon as he woke up and traveled across the mountain, and the Guevarians  went back where they came from. Guevarous, was held in a civilian's house. A women who thought the man was handsome, fell in love with the villain. They had their romantic love whenever she visited his imprisonment. They beared a child. The woman, Veriana had a vision by Adeo and told her to leave and take her son and join the tribe. She did what Adeo told her to. A few minutes after she left out of sight, two soldiers came into the house where they held Guevarous captive and slaughtered him. One soldier got his sword and beheaded him. The other stabbed his torso. The Guevarians met Veriana and she was blessed by the prophets as a member of the tribe. Her child was presented to Adeo. Her child, Marximus, was raised by soldiers and his mother. Without any notification, the idea of Guevarous, not surviving was known by everyone since he hasn’t returned. Past tribe members who remember the escape and the victories, remember him deeply and structured a statue of him. They will carry him around every where they stop. This was recorded by scripture after scriptures who wrote the same story and was told by everyone. Thus the famine ended and the tribe found a spot they stopped  for 3 months, and now they continue to look, as of now they are searching for lands and the story of Guevarous will be told for eternity.</p1></h2></center>
