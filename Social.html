<center<h2>Welcome to the Social part of Guevaria, here you will read about how the social structure is in Guevaria and what the people do with their lives and how they live.</h2>
<h3>Many civilizations were structured in their society, in our civilization, our groups consist of the priest and prophets being at the top of the hierarchy, they were the ones who got into dedication with our God, Adeo, and our people believed that Adeo picked holy people for the society, who will be the chief that guide the people, who is under the laws, inspired by our God. What falls under them are the people of the society, there wasn’t any inequality between our people, there was no wealthier class or poor classes. All the society need to contribute to enrich the society, the men’s job was to serve in the army. From the beginning, of the male toddlers years, they need to learn to ride, starting on sheep because they couldn’t ride horses yet, in our territory many horses could be found in the area. Their tasks were to train with a miniature bows to learn to shoot, like shooting rodents and birds. As the older males grow strength and military skills, they will be graduated to their own horse. As they grew older, they were more advanced and needed to shoot foxes and hares, with a bow and arrow, spears, as they trained from childhood they will be able to be part of the army. Everyone in the society, had to contribute to provide for their families. The men needed to get meat, protect the group, make tents, serve in the army. In the other hand, the women, also need to contribute in the society, women needed to produce children for the population to grow, make cheese, get milk from the sheep and goats, to provide for their families. The list of laws our people were under, 

No stealing
No murder
No sexual immorality
Respect elders
Not to leave the tribe
Do what chief demands
Don’t disrespect both laws and, even if you're a prophet, chief or priest
Don’t talk slander toward Adeo
Men work
Women work
Women produce children
Once children reach the age of 15 they begin to do the same Labor as Man 
Eldest rest
Don’t fall behind
Marriage before mating
Men work to protect the society in army
Male children are required to learn to ride and shoot(military skills) 
Attend tabernacle

The people had to follow the laws of Adeo, and the laws that were of the society in general. The punishments were the following. If a man steals, he will have one of his hand cuted, if he steals again, he’ll have his other hand cutted If a man takes an eye, tooth, hand, arm, foot ,or fingers, He will lose the very same he did that because he believed in equality, and it wasn’t fair if a man cut off another man's hand; and they get an arm cut off. So to keep it equal it was eye for an eye, hand for a hand and so on and so forth.  If a man is wicked, he’ll be stoned. If there is blasphemy against Adeo, you'll be wiped in the center of the city, for everyone to see. The main person that judges is Adeo, your actions will determine if you will enter Zanidus (heaven), if you break the laws you will be going to hell;Perdition. The high priest has the authority to determine your actions, if you did break the law. Those who obeyed the law will be rewarded, by given cheese and milk from the animals from the society, it wasn’t given for free. Only for those who obeyed and males of the family, who served in the army to protect the society.</h3>
