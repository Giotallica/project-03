<h1>Adeo</h1>
<h2><p1>Adeo is the god that the Guevarians believe in. They believe he created human life and is always with them. According to the legend, Guevarous, a leader, lead the tribe away from a kingdom of Talidad, it was Adeo who told him to leave and start a new civilization. Adeo guided them and helped them win all the battles, he also handed the ancient laws to Guevarous which is in the Arc of Adeo today. Adeo is the judge and protecter, he judges you and if you have been a good soul, he'll send you to Zanidus, where he is and will be in paradise, and if you chose to be bad, then he'll send you to Paradition. Adeo is always with the Guevarians no matter what, he is the king of kings and Gods of all mortal Gods.</p1></h2>
