<center><h4><p2>In a not too distant future of México City, México, is a land of scum and villainy. From the cry of children, to the laughter of the cartels, is land that thirst for justice and order. The police won’t handle anything for they themselves are tired of the crime. But this is a story of a young volunteer who chooses to fight for justice and serve and protect the city of México. Pedro Alejandro Perez Gonzalez or Pedro is a young man who grew up in the south end side of México City. He grew up with his father Ramon Pedro Perez, and his mother Maria Norma Gonzalez Chavez. His relatives are his 3 brothers and 3 sisters, he is the eldest of them all. Pedro grew up in the old Grimy barn, in the edge of the street and a large mountain side across the street. In front of their house is another farmland and then the large mountains are a behind it, as if it is the sky. They live in a 2 bedroom house, with a small kitchen and a wide living room that is filled with the virgin of Mary and Jesus Christ on the cross all over the walls, and the restroom is the out house so if you need to use it in the middle of the night, you have to fight the cold. Pedro went to school in a old Barn house, then went to a middle school in another barn house, until his blessing mother got the raise from her job which is a tailor, had him and his brother and sisters to go to school in a big high school in the city side of México City. There Pedro met friends, left friends behind and fell in love with a girl. Her name is Andrea Flores. He loved her but was shy. He played guitar to her and sang to her. She liked him as well but never showed it. They go to a big high school called Guevara Escuela de Secundaria. It is a large school with a fence in the back with a large field and graffiti writing all over the walls. It is a school that takes up an entire block on the city, buses and cars always pass by the main street. Pedro was very good at math that he got accepted to a higher level of knowledge. He eventually graduated and then got a job in selling cars with his Uncle, Miguel Pancho Perez. He tested him before he got the job and by August 27th, he got his job in dealing cars and selling them to many. He uses math and literacy since he has to count amounts of money and how much he is selling, and also get people to buy these cars. One day, Pedro and his friend Raul who he known since grade schools, want to throw a party. Pedro goes home to his house filled with Virgins of Mary's and Jesus Christ, the lord and Savior on a cross all over the place. His mother is a super catholic who believes that the Virgin of Mary all over the house would bless the place and free away from sin. Even though the father is a super alcoholic. He asked for permission to go to the party but he is ignored by his raging parents, fighting and throwing dishes and beer bottles at each other. It became a mad house, porcelain on the floor, his brothers and sisters screaming and fighting. Ramon, slapping his mother on her cheek. He takes it as a yes and then goes to the party with Raul. They ride a red chevy down the night street of the City.The city was filled with lights and bright colors, beautiful sight of Mexico. They arrived at the party. It is a house with a gate and a garden of plants and trash. Surrounding the area was blasting corridos and Mariachi. There his eyes see the one and only, Andrea Flores. Pedro greets her, “Hello.” “Hi, how are you!”, she replies. “Good, and you?” said Pedro.“good” she gave a worm smile. Pedro blushed and then tried changing the situation, “So, what have you been doing lately?” he casually asked. “I've been going on road trips to help the poverty, I am starting an organization that is non profitable, just donations and health supplies to the poor” she proudly continues. “Wow, your such a great person and unique for doing that” Pedro thanked her. “Yeah, it opens my eyes to see the real world” she added. They both smiled at each other and then got a little close. He put his arm around her then got nervous and backed out.“Sorry” he covers up his action. “It's ok” she says as it wasn't a problem . They continue to talk and then Raul hollars for Pedro like a hyena. He calls him over for hot activity that the chicks are about to do. Pedro isn’t interested in lust activity for he is in love with only one soul. Raul mimics his ideology and hands him a bottle of Tecate. He drinks it and then desires more and more. He then got intoxicated and the performed what he swore to not do. After a few hours, the after party had begun. Pedro and Raul took a ride in the back of the pick up truck with women cuddling them and a friend who was driving them. They Brigaded all the way up to the Border. They ended up at Texas and then when they got the the Lone State, they stopped at a friend’s house.It was a rich 2 story house, a nice garden and it was off of an empty street but only few was the far wall of the border.Pedro was dancing and juggling his beer in the house filled with lamps, rich couch and music. Andrea was disappointed at what was going on and left back home. Pedro never noticed her leaving. Pedro had his fun with beer and women which served why Andrea left. Pedro got so drunk that he passed out. The next day he woke up, he ended up on a desert. He woke up to and glanced at a cloth that was acting like a ceiling. He was in a tent. Surrounding him was animals that appeared alive but didn’t move. Then he sees an old man. “Amigo, yo lo arescare a ti.” he tells him. “ thanks?” he replies. The old man tells him in spanish he has been saved. “You see, I saved you with my potions.”  Pedro observes around the room. Then he leaves and then as surprised as anyone could be, he is blind by the sunlight. Across the barren street is a desert. He takes a step back as the sand crunches and then the old man says “Amigo, you are rescued, I saved you.”. “What do you mean?” puzzled, Pedro asked. “Amigo, you were passed out on this road, you have been lying there like a churro. I saved you and pick you up on my Burro and took you to shelter.” Pedro sarcastically observes the mini tent as it is shelter. This old man was an old Aztec Gypsy who believes in the power such as the Aztec did.He wore an old sarape, sandals and old white pants. He had necklaces teeth, bones and claws around his neck, wore a bandana that had a snake on it that acted alive. He held positions and home remedies and cured Pedro. “How did you wake me?” Pedro asked. “I used cocaine, calcium and potassium to awake you, you were drunk.” Answered the old man “Ok”replied Pedro. “ Amigo, this is your destiny and what the coyote speaks, a hero that will defeat the Jaguar,” Pedro is more than puzzled, “What?” “You see, I have seen it in a vision, a hero will be from a middle of a road, blessed and will rise to defeat evil, I gave you powers and only way to unlock it is with this” he shows him a tecate bottle. “Are you serious?” asked Pedro. “Trust me”. Pedro then drinks the beer bottle in confusion, then he becomes stronger, energetic and worried. “Que estas pasando!” Pedro yells. “Amigo, you are becoming a hero.” Answered the old man. Pedro then feels that he has powers. “Gracias, um…” “Juarez” interrupts Juarez. “Me llamo Juarez.” “Gracias” Pedro gladly replies. He then ask him a question. “So is there a car or a horse I ride?” Juarez whistles and his donkey appears. “Ok the beer, the desert and now a donkey, this is degrading.” said Pedro. “Amigo, he is a my dearest friend, he too believes in you, he will take you home.” “I guess so, adios Juarez.” farewells Pedro. “Adios Amigo!” replies Juarez. Pedro sits on the burro and then the donkey takes off into the sky. He is flying on a donkey all the way home. When he gets to the city, Pedro sees all the crime and villainy. Then realizes what he meant by the evil doer, he has to stop crime and evil in this city, for with great power comes great.. “Bang!” a bomb had exploded. Pedro was blown off into the street. He sees the explosion and then heads towards whats going on. It was a robbery at the bank. Smoke and scream filled the air. Pedro ran into the fog of smoke and yelled for anyone who is injured and inside the destroyed bank. “Hola Amigo!” an unfriendly voice said sarcastically. With him was a middle age man with a bandana and a club on his left arm. He was about to club him in the head until Pedro swiftly moved a side away from the fire and the man who swung him lost balanced and fell into the fiery hell. The other crook snaked up behind him and grabbed his mouth, muffling in terror, Pedro was squirming, “Who do you think you are?” he diabolically he asked. “I am someone who you will love to hate.” Replied Pedro, he than used his strength to break the strangle hold and threw his heavy cold body outside of the broken wall and then caught up to him. Pedro was beating him to pulp and then jumped on his donkey and fly away. The criminal got up from the street that he was hurled and then the police arrived and arrested him. Pedro flew to his friend’s house. He landed on the hooves of his donkey and then walked up the steps to Raul’s house. It was a green house with beer bottles and trash all over the place. His house is in between the city side and the south barren side of Mexico City. He knocked the wooden door. Pedro felt splinters on his hands. Then a loud crash of glass and wood was heard. The facial expression of Pedro was contorted at the sound of the disturbance. “Who is it?” yelled Raul. “Es Pedro!” yelled Pedro through the outdoor. “Oh Pedro, Orale, man how are you, come in come in!” his key of voice changed when he replied. Pedro creeked the door open and walked right in. He stepped on napkins and Tecate cans.The smell that filled that air was repulsive. “Sorry about the mess, I am cleaning out my bedroom.” Pedro nodded sarcastically. “Man, foo you were passed out last time I saw you, how did you do it.” he asked in astonishment. “Foo, I don’t know, what happened.” “You were drinking like un borracho de Cerro Cabezon, you then got to the back of the pick up with me and some muchachas and then headed out to Texas. You stayed in the pick up with the 2 girls and you were having a fun time with them, then we were forced to go back to Mexico or we will get deported and get our car impounded, so we left and then we went down the desert of Chihuahua and then hit a bump and you fell out of the car and we didn’t notice till today.” “Damn” Pedro spoke. “But man how did you stay alive?” Raul continued. “Un viejo, some old man, loco, he saved me and gave me some magic potion that helped me wake up, he’s un gypsy, magic of Azteca.” he explained. “Ohhh!” Raul was dumbfounded. “Si, y sabes que?” he asked. “Que?” eagerly asked Raul. “give me that tecate.” “Man I only have one” complained raul. “Just gimme” “ok man, you owe me” “Ok”.Raul rammed through the trash and got the beer bottle and handed it to Pedro. The freezing glass that touched Pedro gave him a shiver. Pedro drank the beer and gave a refreshing throat exhale and then he started screaming and then shaking. Raul’s face was the color of milk and his eyes was as wide as an owl. The commotion stopped and then Pedro was calm. “What happened?” Raul asked in fear. “Amigo, look I have powers.” Pedro excitedly replied. “Que dices!” he asked again. “Power, I have power” he answered in long syllables. Raul was opened jawed and silent. “Through that book at me.” commanded Pedro. Raul grabbed the book on the table and threw it as hard as he can. Pedro stuck his chest out and merely quivered then stood like a statue. “Wow!” Raul was astonished. “Right jaja” he continued. Raul grabbed a beer bottle and bashed it on his head. Pedro screamed in pain and fell on the floor of cans and dirty napkins. “Ah, what the hell dude!” Pedro yelled. “Perdon Hermano, I thought you said you are strong.” Raul asked in confusion. Pedro got up from the floor and wiped the blood and glass off of his head. “I am but I never said I feel pain”. Pedro harangued. Pedro walked outside into the sunset and called Raul to meet him there. Both of the men was out in the cracked street.Silent area, no cars coming by, no children playing, just a desolated area with matching houses like this. The hot breeze blew from all ends. Pedro asked him for money. “What you need my money for?” Raul growled. “Just give it to me.” Pedro asked in annoyed ment. He handed him 10 pesos and Pedro ran as fast as a cheetah, and came back with a tecate. “Here you go brother.” He said while he handed him his beer. “Wow, y gracias.” he said in delightment. “Man you do have power.” Raul congratulated him. “Oye, you are a hero, si, you have powers, you are a good person I know, you are a hero man.” “I know man, I already punish the men who robbed the bank down at the city.” Replied Pedro. Pedro left Raul and went home to his parents. “Hola Ma” he greeted. “Hola mijo, why are you coming a day late, where have you been.” she worriedly said. “Ah, just at my friend’s house, I was at a party when you and pa was fighting, and how is he?” “he is good, we stopped fighting right when you left, we talked and then went to sleep, he went to work and so it's just me, the kids are at school.” “bueno, a ma, ya me voy a dormir,” “Ok, you look tired.” “Oh mom, I forgot, some old man gave me this donkey, I don’t know why, can I keep it here?” lied Pedro “Si, mijo” she said. Pedro walked to the backyard and left his donkey there. “Oye man, que estas haciendo?” a voice came. “Que?” Pedro turned around and search all over the barn for a person and all he saw was a wall with graffiti, chickens, long crops, weeds, cows and goats. “Down here foo!” it yelled again. Pedro looked down and then yelled in shock. “You, you can talk?” “No!, I am just saying yee ha and you're imagining things.” the donkey snarked back in sarcasm. “Hell yeah I am talking, I am your talking and flying donkey, I am your sidekick and your loyal friend.” proudly the animal said. “My noble friend is a donkey, what royal respect.” Pedro replied in sarcasm also. “No man, Juarez is the truth, he believed in a prophecy of a hero with a donkey as his companion, that's me and you, the prophecy of a hero that was on the road, past out and then reborn, that's you, you are that hero.” the donkey was reasoning. Pedro took a long stare and was puzzled. “I am not a hero, just a person with a potion that some old guy turned into a hero, doesn’t make me a hero.” Pedro irritatedly said. “Well hell, you are a hero, I know your intentions when you were fighting those crooks, you wanted to punish them for robbing a bank, you are a hero for punishing them, we know those pigs won’t do it, that's where you come in, you are that hero to do what is good in this city.” the donkey continued. “Ugh,” he expressed, he then took a long sigh “Listen, I do feel that this city is corrupted with evil, but I am not a hero, I am more like a vigilante, a hero who isn’t established you know.” “well it is up to you man, I ain’t no jesus nor Buddha, I am just a donkey, so do whatever you do, but no that everything you do, will cause some effect.” Pedro was silent, then walked to the house, he went to his room and then attempted to sleep. He was resting on his bed. He was pondering about whether to really become a hero or to pass that option. He then realize about his father, he was a criminal and he was a killer, a drug abuser and a fiend. Pedro suddenly grasped that chills and realize this is a chance to show that there is good in everyone, if he could show how good he is and yet he is the son of a killer, then he may realize all he done was in the past and he can still change. Pedro then chose his destiny to fight for mankind and stop evil. Pedro fell asleep that night. The next day, he left early to the store to buy clothes, he bought a sombraro, a sarape and a red and white shirt button shirt, and old white slacks. He then got a 24 pack of beer and then went to the weapon store to buy 2 pistols, a lasso and a knife. His mother was at church and his father was at home, sleeping on the couch with the tv on. Pedro walked to his room and then started crafting his suit. He put on the white pants,fitted well and snugged, the red and white plaid button shirt, wore a sarape loose  like a cape, but on the bandit mask that he crafted out of old black bandana and wore his white sombrero. He then settled up on his donkey. “Gitty up.” he yelled. “Alright, someone came to there senses.” said the animal in confidence and in the way he was corrected in the first place.“So what is your name?” he starts off. “Eh, I'm Enrique!” Enrique replies . They took off into the sky and then flew to the city. There he saw two kids walking down the street and then 2 cartels ready to harass them. Pedro snuck up behind them and landed 5 feet away from the alley of where they were chasing them. “Ahh, no no, please don’t kill us, please!” the kids pleaded. “Listen, you just tell us where you live, and we’ll leave you alone ok?” one of the cartels dealt. “No” the girl said in return. “Vaya pues,” he said in disappointment, one of the cartels stook a knife and then was ready to stab the girl, until Pedro realized that those kids they were about to murder was his brother and sister. Pedro ran down the sidewalk and into the alley. “Alto!” yelled Pedro. The cartels ignored the yell and continued to press his knife on his sister. Pedro then grabbed the cartel with the knife and then bang his head on the hard brick all in the alley, he then grabbed him up again and punched him in the face. Both of the victims was relieve and surprised at the action. The other cartel ran away, Pedro caught up to him on his donkey and then turned got in front of the runner, turned around and donkey kicked him all the way back to the alley. Pedro glared at the 2 bodies knocked out on the sidewalk that is round. Pedro got off of his donkey and then ran to him. “No senior, person, please have mercy on us!” the both pleaded as children. “I am going to show mercy, but remember who you just met right now, I am your water of the fire, the white to the black, the bible to the lost soul, I am the one that will stop this villainy, so warn your friends to never try this again. “Ok!” they begged. The both ran away but turns out he tied them along a lamp stomp and then the fell from being tugged. Pedro walked to his brother and sister. “Gracias senor.” the gratefully thanked him. “Den nada!” Pedro said, masking his voice. “Quien es?” the girl asked. “Soy un hero” he replied in a heroic tone. He got on his donkey and flew away. Both of the kids were awed at the sight of him flying to thin air. The police arrived and picked up the criminals and a note was left, it was a mexican flag. The police looked up at the sky puzzled. Meanwhile in the house of the smugglers, there was a club of evil men, one of them was Ricardo Manuel Suarez Ramirez. He was a head of the mafia, he ordered the crime, drugs and killings. He was having a meeting in a small meeting room that smelled like marijuana and was filled with white smoke and the only light that was light was a small lamp. The meeting was about what happened with 2 of his cartels, they found out on television that they were stopped somehow and were tied up among the pole and a not was left. “There is a vigilante, a hero poser, who is stopping our business!” Ricardo yelled. He was holding a meeting with his leaders of task of his mafia. “You see, someone knows who we are, the left this note, I am not risking this, the policia is using a method of scaring us, but I am not scared, I am more entertain on how much trouble we brought that a stupid hero is needed, the cops can’t do there job right that they need a retarded masked hero to stop us, I want to meet this foo, see if he can maybe join us, we are both outcast secretly, lets lure him!” he orders. The all agree and the plot to set up the hero. Pedro was still dressed in his outfit and then heard a scream down in the central of Mexico City, it was a women, it was Andrea. He raced down to where she was. It was one of the mafia member who was harassing her. She was putting up a fight but the cartel was strangling her and striping her cloths. “Hola amigo” the hero snarked. He was holding a pistol, hidden and out of sight, the man pulled a gun and right when he was aiming, Pedro shot him cold blooded. Andrea screamed at the sight. The hero walked up to her and said  “baya, you're safe now, go before you get in more trouble” he ordered her while masking his voice. She hugged him and then ran away. He watch her leave and was off guard when another cartel came and put him on headlock. The 2 were fighting until Pedro got a good grip on him and tossed him in front of him. He walked up to him and socked him on the spinal cord and then left him on the floor. Others came and attempted the same trick up he shot them both with his 2 pistols. Then finally Ricardo snuck a beer bottle that he dropped during the combat, and threw it at his head. Pedro was knocked out. Ricardo and his men carried him to the van and took off to his mafia house. The drag him down the dark hallways with paintings of the killings they had done on the sidewalls. The opened the door and entered a prison like room. Cells every wall, bricked wall and a leaking ceiling that’s dripping water. The locked him up in the cell and shut the door. Pedro was sitting in the dimmed room that is at least a regular american house room wide. Bugs, and rats crawled all over the place, writing on the walls and blood on the floor. Pedro stayed there for uncountable amount of days, he wore a thick beard and grown scrawny after days of not eating. All he was consuming was his beer that he kept hidden incase they take his stuff away. He drank it and then got his powers. Then he realizes he can escape, but what the use of powers with no weapons, they confiscated his weapons while he was knocked out. Pedro then drank a beer, then got his powers back. He kicked the cell gate open. Then busted through the wooden door and ended up in the dark hallways. He tiptoed to find an escape. But then remembered to get his weapons. He took a turn to the right direction of the hall. Then entered a hallway with doors every side. He walked up every door and then pressed his ear among it to here for voices. He finally found one in particular, that had the recognizable tone of Ricardo. Pedro, then placed a mark on it by breaking his beer bottle and then using the sharp edge of the glass to scratch a mark. He then left and was gamboling which door had his equipment. One door he busted opened had the donkey. He untied it and then set him free.“Ah thanks man, they were about to play pin the tale.” Enrique gladly thanked him. They both busted the 2nd door and there was 2 cartels. Enrique charged up to them and donkeyed kicked them. They flew and broke through the window. Pedro got his equipment suit but not his weapons. He put on his sombraro, sarape and his cloths. Pedro then went back to the other door where he left the mark. Broke through and his donkey charged everyman inside and donkey kicked them. Ricardo got up and harangued his men to go after them. Enrique ran and they all chased him. Ricardo went after them. Little did they know Pedro was hiding under a table. He got up and then grab his 2 pistols, knife and lasso. He originally planned so he walked every door and glanced to see an exit. One door he opened and then saw a room where a chainsaw was hanging from the ceiling and clubs on the wall. He tried to hide there in case any more men come. Ricardo glanced in the room and then told one of the cartels to grab the chainsaw. The man obtain the saw and pulled the switch. The loud growl of the saw emerged. Pedro got out of his hiding place which was a chair and the threw it as Ricardo and ran away. Ricardo fell on the marble floor and the donkey ran back to save him and kicked the stuff off of the counter which was HCA. It fell on Ricardo and the donkey ran away. The man with the chainsaw chased after Enrique but slipped on the acid and fell aswell and the chainsaw cutted the hand off. Ricardo screamed in hell and remained where he was. Pedro got on his donkey and flew down the halls and found the exit and escaped. They both flew away from the mafia house and went back home. On his way home, he sees the mayor of Mexico CIty about to get robbed from another criminal. Pedro pull over his donkey and flies down towards the trouble. He lands and grabs his lasso of the loop gets his foot caught when he stepped forward and tripped. He pulled him toward and then left a mark on him, the mark he left on the other man he caught. He tied him to a cop car door handle that was nearby. Pedro sat on top of the donkey and ran away. People standing by tried getting his attention but merely saw him leave. The mayor had a press conference about what happened the next day. “Hermanos, I have been saved, and many others were saved as well, as we see, we have a hero in Mexico City, Bold, Brave, and courageous. Willing to do all he can to stop the scum of this city. I too am grateful I am alive and didn’t get robbed. As many who was saved is as well. I, Miguel Ángel Mancera Espinosa, had agree with many others, that we will acknowledge this hero for eternity. He is our mask hero, who appears as a deadly bandito, to the criminals and evildoers. He is the light of the dark, the water of the fire, the Angel to the Devil. He is a leader, who will set an example to our city and hopefully our entire country. His name is unknown to us, but we see him as a capitan, Capitan Mexico.”The crowd was clapping in the town hall press meeting. Citizens were watching on their televisions, hearing on radios about the word. Pedro is known as a hero and a protector around Mexico City. Meanwhile, in the desolated mafia household. Ricardo suddenly wakes up from his sleep. He got up and his body is body is torn. His face is burned from the acid, grotesque, bloody, scared up and bumps all over, his right arm is cut off and his body is bleeding from the acid seeping into his pores. He heads over to an underground doctor who charges very low. He goes inside the basement of an abandoned bar. In there it is very dim, with a dwindling light and posters all over the wall. “Ah, bien venidos” the doctor greeted. When he suddenly glanced at who was walking in, his grin switch to a frightened face. “Uh, ahem, uh, Senior Ricardo, what a pleasant surprise.” The doctor was quivering. “Buenas noches, Dr. Fernandez” he growls. “Ricardo, how may I assist you?” he pleads. “Try to make me a more of a monster than I already am” he implies. “Si senor” he rushes to get his equipment. Clang and banging the equipment roughly move. He frantically gather his things and sets up the operation. “Doctor, you might need this” Ricardo insisted. He gives him the revolver. He then shows him his right arm. Dr Fernandez trembles. “Si senor, right away.” He says. Dr. Fernandez sets up the operation. He remained Ricardo on the table, and then start cutting his right arm open. Places a machine to hold bullets. He then covers the surrounding area with metal and the bullets in a tight compartment. He connects the arms to move up and down, to pull the bullet to the gun that is acting as a hand piece. He connects the gun to the arm socket and it becomes one. When ever he stretches his arm over extendedly, the bullets pull up to the gun, and then he fires. His arm muscle pressure is what fires the bullet. He than gave him a metal face to cover the side that was wounded from the acid. He covered his grotesgue, cratered, bloody, scared and pusy face with a metal piece that fitted well on it. He then covered his body wounds, from the right side of the torso to the beginning part of the right thigh. “Ya termine” he said in encouragement and hope he wouldn't reject his work. “Pasame me la espejo” yells Ricardo. The man searches frantically, “La Espejo!” he growls again. Dr. Fernandez finally finds it and handed it to him. Ricardo snatches is from his fingers and observes. He then begins to chuckle and laugh, then he laughs maniacally. He turned his arm and pressed his muscle. “BANG!” the shot was fired. Dr Fernandez collapse on the counter of equipment. Ricardo heads outside. The next night. Ricardo causes trouble and bullets were fired everywhere at the bank. The mad gunslinger is shooting at everyone, blindly and sometimes intentionally. Pedro hears the incident on televisions at home and then goes to his room and then gets into his hero suit. Capitan Mexico is up for another challenge again. He gets his beer and chugs it down in one breath. Slams the bottle on the dresser and jogs to his donkey. “Gitty up!” he hollars. They both fly to where the calamity is. Capitan Mexico drops off and then confronts the evil doer. “Alto!” he yells. The gunslinger with the metal face meets his eyes. He wore a black sombrero, black leather jacket, black pants, and black leather boots. “JAJA, WE MEET AGAIN!”  the sadistic freak yells. “Again?” Capitan Mexico repeated. “You senor, is under arrest,” he orders. “Jaja, you really think you can stop me, I am EL Loco, and I believe we are going to have a great relationship!” the cynical man counters back sarcastically. “Well whenever there is good, there is evil” Agrees Capitan Mexico. He then attempts to trap him in his lasso but El Loco swiftly moves, then fires 3 shots at him. Capitan Mexico dodges. Capitan Mexico then grabs his gun and plays his game. They both fire at each other. Then El Loco Ran away. Capitan Mexico stood there watching him go in confusion. He then heads home and ponders who is this new foe. Pedro, the next day is at his work, tired and confused. He sees Andrea at the shop. “Hola” she says in excitement. “Hola” he says in return. “Been awhile since we have seen each other” she starts off. “I know”. He says smiling.“Listen, I am sorry for what happened that night” he apologises. “Oh, it's ok, just promise you won do it again” she says. “Haha ok” Pedro smiles. “Haha yeah, well I need help with my brother, he is trying to get a car and I thought maybe you can help him.” she continues. “Oh que bueno, si puede hacer eso” he says trying to get her hopes up in his trust. “Oh awesome” she hugs him. They hug and then before she left, he asked her a question. “Andrea, I wanted to know if you wanted, to, Um, go eat somewhere?” he blushed. “Of Course, she says, I would love that, when?” she says blushing back. “Tonight” he propose. “Yes, ok, here's my number” she continues. They exchange phone numbers and then leaves. Later that night they have their date at a restaurant. Andrea was wearing a red dress in elegancy that matches her personality. Pedro was wearing a suit. They talked and laughed. Then suddenly chaos was born. El Loco confronted them after killing the chef which was the delay of there food. Pedro sees the foe in the kitchen then asked to be excused by Andrea. He hides outside, out of sight and dresses in Capitan Mexico. He drinks his beer and then gets his powers. He confronts El Loco. Andrea then is delighted to see her hero again. He walked up to her, telling her if she is ok. She says yes and then he moves on to face El Loco. El Loco blast bullets again and fires at everyone. Capitan Mexico shoves Andrea to the floor to avoid her getting pierced by the bullet. He then gets up and throws the first punch. They fight until El Loco head-butted him.
