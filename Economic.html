<center><h2><p1>Welcome to the Economic section of Guevaria. Here you will read about what Guevaria produce, sell and get in return. As if you noticed, Guevaria is a society based off of religion. They don't have currency but merely trade goods. If you wish to read more about the Economic structure, continue to read more about it below.</p1></h2></center>
<center><h3>For economics, we trade with our fellow neighbors. To travel we ride on horses. We trade with horses, cheese and other foods to get wood and iron in return. We don’t have a currency but trade. We produce cheese, milk and raise horses and other domestic animals in our farms. We get the cheese and milk from cows and goats. As well as, the animals skins, to make tents bags carry the goods, and horns to carry liquids, such as milk and water. Men gather food and is not paid in return, but his personal materials can be traded with someone else's owning, even someone from another society. Women are allowed to trade as well. Guevarians get their knowledge from other societies because before trading, all they knew is their religious beliefs and education in war, learning military skills. Now because of trading, they know how to read, write, math and philosophy. This is passed down from generation to generation where now the tribe knows a bit more knowledge than before.</h3></center>
