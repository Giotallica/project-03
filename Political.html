<center><h1>Political</h1></center>
<center><h2>Welcome to the Poltical side of our Guevaria, her you will learn about the governments and leaders of this civilization and how people get to become a government or a vote for one.</h2></center>
<center><h3>The Political structure of our tribe is theocracy, it is ruled under a religion and that runs the political side and many other aspects of this tribe. The government figure is a chief, he enforces the law and demands the Guevarians what to do. He is in charge and is selected by the priest who is anointed and selected by our god Adeo. The chief demands whether the tribe should migrate, or stay in a spot. He is allowed to carry punishments if necessary and rewards if necessary. He is the figure and the head of the tribe and they must obey him, he is under the law as well. Chiefs are males and has assistance along in his rule, they are rewarded with his gratitude and his full respect. When he is gone, they are usually automatic chosen by the priest to lead the next chief. The chief is in the chief’s tent where the soldiers remain. The chief’s area is surrounded by forts and only special request men are allowed to visit the chief. Not anyone is to see him. A priest is selected by the prophets, which are told by Adeo who is to be next head of the tribe. A priest selection is a different because not anyone can be a priest. He must be a holy man, must be pure and must be an adult male, anointed by Adeo. A priest job is to make sure everyone knows the word of Adeo. He is too pray for needs, assemble the worship at the tabernacle and dismiss the guevarians. He presents the law and the word at the tabernacle and is allowed to call out punishments and demands the chief to carry it. There is a council of 5 priest who all agree to select a chief. Whenever a chief is reported a terrible chief and if more than 10 Guevarians claim he is a bad chief, he will be removed from his place and will select another chief. These arrangements happen only in the tabernacle. If a chief was caught sinning against Adeo and against the priest and prophets, he will be expelled from the ministry and will be forced to work hard labor till death. If a priest is to sin against the ministry, he will be expelled from the council and be forced to work hard labor until death. Priest are in the tabernacle at all times, praying and speaking with god, unless it’s time for the tribe to move. Priest sleep in their private tents by the tabernacle. Priest allow anyone to the tabernacle, even in non-service hours, unless they feel like worshiping and praying. Prophets are in their secluded area of the tribe. He is focused on Adeo and is constantly in a prayer and fasting. If one disturbs the prophet from prayer he shall be punished. Prophets are able to speak when he isn’t praying, when he summons a Guevarian, or when he is in the tabernacle. He sleeps in his private tent but is only their for slumber. If an elder or prophet sins against the ministry,( he will be smited by Adeo) he will be punished and expelled from the ministry. A prophet is selected by “Adeo” ( it is hereditary). The bloodline of prophet don’t get riches, he is to study all his life of the lord and must participate in priest and council actions. He is then selected when by the past prophet who is usually the father of him. He is selected and becomes the prophet. He is the holiest man and selects the council. All priest, prophets, and chiefs don’t get currency for their position. All they do is spread Adeo’s word, and leading the people through his path.</h3></center>
