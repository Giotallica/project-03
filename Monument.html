<center><h1><p1>The Soul purpose of the Monument is because it hold in the laws that Adeo handed down to Guevarous, the great leader. During the crusade of Guevarous. He lead the tribe to escape from Talidad because it was a corrupt kingdom. They left and marched on to search for the promise land. Guevarous was guided by Adeo to lead the tribe to paradise. Wars and battled accrued but with the ultamite faith they held. The prevailed. Months after, Adeo lead Guevarous to the rocky mountain of where lighting and thunder struck. There, Adeo handed down the laws of Adeo. The laws was then scripted into paper by the priest and prophets, years after the death of Guevarous. After Guevarous’ death. His son Marximus who was born to his mother, Veriana. Marximus he;d the laws and instructed a prayer to them. He himself constructed the ark out of gold since it is a color of majestic and honor. Once he crafted the ark, he placed the laws in them. The Ark is a golden casket like structure, that’s a square shaped casket. And the cover is a youngman (who is rumored that it is Guevarous). Praying to Adeo, and the angels on the side praying to him. It is a symbol of honor and worship. As you see the man praying to Adeo is a being worshiped by angels because he is setting the bigger example to them, so they look up to him. The monument holds the laws since it is stoned crafted and can possibly break. It is a centerpiece of the civilization because they believed their society would never be alive if it wasn’t for Adeo, Guevarous and Marximus. It is merely small compared to many other Monuments because this is a nomadic tribe, therefore they move place to place and it is meaningless to create a large Monument since they hardly stay in a spot for a whole day. It is small and easy to carry with them to place to place. It is worshiped and prayed because it is the only artifact that resembles Adeo since know one knows what he looks like. It stands bold and honored for eternity and will always be respected by every Guevarian.</p1></h1></center>
