<center><h3><p1>Welcome to the Intellectual section of Guevaria, this is what is the foundation of this society, it is all based on religion and believes. According to the legend, Guevarous was marching on and created his tribe which is what the Guevarians are.Guevarous was a leader with Adeo on his side, legends write that miracles and blessings happened during the crusade. Laws was handed down and they won battles. Priest and Prophets are the rulers and the people below them are ordinary tribe members. Everyone is treated equal.

<center><h5>Guevarians are a Monotheistic, and monotheistic means, relating to or characterized by the belief that there is only one God. We believe that, there is only one God and that’s Adeo. Our people, core value is to the “submission to God” Now under him who helped us as the society, were the Priest and Prophets, our religious leaders who run the tabernacle services, and who were constantly in prayer. They were there to help us get through our problems if needed. The prophets are like our fortune tellers, who warn us if it’s fine to travel to a certain direction, the weather, if we will win  a war, etc. Although we accomplished many things, although we were able to overcome things that weren’t possible for all, we still had our own minor problems. So we could stay sane and not go crazy the priest were there. Teaching us the word of God, praying with us, fellow shipping with us and many more things just so we can give our time to God (Adeo) as well. The belief of the afterlife is that all men and women go to a place called Zanidus(heaven). Zanidus is the reward when you are a good soul who and does the work of Adeo. Adeo will send you to the dimension of where Adeo is and you will remain there for eternity. Beliefs consist that people of the scriptures and Guevarous himself, is up in the kingdom of Zanidus. For the sinners and evildoers they go to a place called Perdition. In there they will suffer for eternity for the disrespect Adeo. As for festivals and holidays,  we sacrifice animals for Adeo, by the tabernacle. As for weddings occur through religious pathway, and then there is a afterdance around the statue of Adeo. When young males, have reach certain age, they are graduated to their own horse, because we have the mindset to military skills.</h5></center>
